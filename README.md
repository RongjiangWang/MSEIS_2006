FORTRAN code for calculating synthetic seismograms based on a layered viscoelastic half-space earth model.

Highlights:

(1) orthonormal propagator algorithm for numerical stability (more efficient than the reflectivity method)

(2) complex frequency technique for supressing the time-domain aliasing problem

(3) wave-number-domain differential filter technique for suppressing numerical phases

(4) various partial solution options

(5) different shallow structures at source and receiver site

(6) earth flattening transformation
